- Maximum: The oldest individual in the dataset is 77 years old.
- Standard Deviation: The age values are spread around the mean by approximately 9.433 years on average.
- Skewness: The distribution of ages is slightly negatively skewed (-0.196), indicating a slight tendency for more individuals to be younger than the mean.
- Kurtosis: The distribution is slightly platykurtic (-0.386), meaning it's slightly flatter than a normal distribution.


2. RestingBP (Resting Blood Pressure):

- Mean: The average resting blood pressure is approximately 132.40 mmHg.

- Minimum: The lowest recorded value of ST depression is -2.6.
- Maximum: The highest recorded value of ST depression is 6.2.
- Standard Deviation: The values of ST depression are spread around the mean by approximately 1.0666 on average.
- Skewness: The distribution of ST depression values is positively skewed (1.023), indicating a slight tendency for more individuals to have higher ST depression values.
- Kurtosis: The distribution is slightly leptokurtic (1.203), meaning it has heavier tails and a sharper peak compared to a normal distribution.

5. Oldpeak:

- There are 918 observations of the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- The mean old peak value is approximately 0.887 with a standard deviation of 1.0666.
- There are no missing values for oldpeak.
- There is 1 extreme value below the lower limit and 15 extreme values above the upper limit.

6. FastingBS (Fasting Blood Sugar):

-There are 918 observations of fasting blood sugar, but the mean and standard deviation are not provided in this table.

7. HeartDisease:

- There are 918 observations of heart disease, with a mean of approximately 0.55 and a standard deviation of approximately 0.497.
- There are no missing values for heart disease, and there are no extreme values (outliers).

For the t-test for Equality of Means, Here is the Interpretation :

This test assesses whether there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups being compared.

1. Age:
- When equal variances are assumed, the t-test statistic (t) is 1.690 with a two-sided p-value of 0.091 (>0.05), suggesting that there is no significant difference in the mean age between the two groups.
- When equal variances are not assumed, the t-test statistic (t) is 1.678 with a two-sided p-value of 0.047 (<0.05), indicating a significant difference in the mean age between the two groups.

2. Cholesterol:
- Both when equal variances are assumed and not assumed, the t-test statistics (t) are significantly negative (-6.181 and -7.238 respectively),
  and the corresponding p-values are extremely small (<0.001), indicating a significant difference in the mean cholesterol levels between the two groups.
- In both cases, the mean cholesterol level in one group is significantly lower than the other.


For Regression Here is the Interpretation :

R squared :
This is the coefficient of determination, representing the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (Age) explained by the predictors. 
In this case, it's approximately 0.239, indicating that around 23.9% of the variance in Age is explained by the predictors.

Adjusted R squared :
This adjusts the R Square value for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate estimate of the model's goodness of fit. 
It's approximately 0.234 in this case.

Standard Error of the Estimate: 
This represents the standard deviation of the residuals (the differences between the observed and predicted values of Age). 
A lower value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. Here, it's approximately 8.254.

Durbin-Watson: 
This statistic tests for the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals. 
The value of 1.644 suggests a moderate positive autocorrelation.

For the Pearson Correlation Matrix Here is the Interpretation :

- Age and RestingBP have a positive correlation of approximately 0.254, indicating that as age increases, resting blood pressure tends to increase as well.
- Age and Cholesterol have a negative correlation of approximately -0.095, suggesting a weak negative relationship between age and cholesterol levels.
- Age and FastingBS have a positive correlation of approximately 0.198, implying that as age increases, fasting blood sugar tends to increase too.
- Age and MaxHR have a strong negative correlation of approximately -0.382, indicating that as age increases, the maximum heart rate achieved tends to decrease.
- Age and Oldpeak have a positive correlation of approximately 0.259, indicating a weak positive relationship between age and the ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- Age and heart disease have a positive correlation of approximately 0.282, suggesting a weak positive relationship between age and the presence of heart disease.
